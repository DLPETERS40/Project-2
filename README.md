##Project Purpose

##Assumptions for Project 2:

##Audience: 
- Policymakers 
- Vehicle Manufacturers 
- EV Engineers 
- EV sales and marketing 
- EV consumers/individual consumers 

Definition of an EV care (carandriver.com): 
- Battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which run entirely on electricity stored in batteries. 
- Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), which use a combination of gasoline and electricity to run. 
- Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which can be plugged in to charge the batteries and use electricity or gasoline to run. 
- Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), which use hydrogen to generate electricity and run. 

##Question
What predictors and classifications of consmuer decisions and attitudes toward electric vehicles makes them likely to puchase an EV?

##Approach 

##Explorations:
o Clusters of vehicle consumers distinguished by demographics, 
environmental and technology attitudes, and EV adoption 
o Demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal predictors of EV adoption 
o Select statistical model with highest accuracy, precision, and sensitivity 

Possible variables:
- Independent variables: Demographics, attitudes (toward environment and technology), and lifestyle choices. 
- Dependent variables: Purchase of or intent to purchase an EV 

Sources: 
- Pew Research Center: Wave 108 of the American Trends Panel: COVID 
and Climate, Energy and the Environment

##About the data: 
- The ATP is Pew Research Centers nationally representative 
online survey panel. The panel is composed of more than 
10,000 adults selected at random from across the entire U.S. 
- For the online panel to be truly nationally representative, the 
share of those who do not use the internet must be 
represented on the panel somehow. In 2021, the share of 
non-internet users in the U.S was estimated to be 7%, and 
while this is a relatively small group, its members are quite 
different demographically from those who go online. In its 
early years, the ATP conducted interviews with non-internet 
users via paper questionnaires. However, in 2016, the 
Center switched to providing non-internet households with 
tablets which they could use to take the surveys online. The 
Center works with Ipsos, an international market and opinion 
research organization, to recruit panelists, manage the panel 
and conduct the surveys. 
- We make a promise to our panelists to protect their identity. 
Several checks and balances are in place to make sure that 
Pew Research Center remains true to its word. Personal 
identifying information (PII) such as a panelists name or 
county of residence is maintained solely by the core panel 
administration team and is never made available to the 
general public. In some cases, additional steps such as data 
swapping randomly swapping certain values among a 
small number of respondents with similar characteristics for 
sensitive questions is also used to protect panelists 
information.

##Licensure and Credits: 
- Open access 
- When using Pew Research Center data, ensure proper 
attribution by mentioning the source. For example:Data from 
the Pew Research Center, [dataset title], [date of data 
collection], [URL to dataset].
- Include the specific dataset title and the date of data 
collection."
